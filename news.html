            <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 700px; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                While Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) is rare worldwide, several cases have been reported in
                Kerala over the years, particularly in coastal districts like Alappuzha. These tragic events highlight
                the critical need for local awareness and caution when interacting with warm, stagnant freshwater
                bodies.
